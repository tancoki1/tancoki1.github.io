About me
======

I'm a third-year student from [School of social sciences](https://www.sss.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). At the same time, I studied economics in the [xuetang program](http://ug.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/bkjbkxm/jjxxtb.htm), and my research interests are mainly focused on microeconomics and empirical applications.

I am excited to be part of the DIMACS REU 2025 program at Rutgers University. I will complete a research project on AI and the economy under the supervision of Prof. Xia and Postdoctoral Fellow Zhang.

You can find my CV:[Tianqi Li's CV](../assets/Tianqi Li's CV 6.18最新.pdf) and previous part of the writing here.

Project Description
======
My research question is whether AI can improve the learning efficiency of high school students by teaching them according to their aptitude. We assume that the learning model is the same for all people at first, and that AI intervention can achieve better efficiency by breaking the information asymmetry and adjusting the elements of each person. Technically, I plan to do simulations using the methods of experimental economics. Ultimately, it is hoped that our research will not only improve the efficiency of individual learning, but also bring some social benefits, such as reducing "involution" and promoting educational equity.

Week 1 (7.30-7.6)
------
This week we arrived at Rutgers and settled in and started cooking for ourselves, thanks to Nadya, Ava and Larry for their help. On Tuesday, I had an in-person meeting with Professor Xia and postdoc Zhang to exchange ideas on research topics. I also went to College Avenue with my classmates this week, and I also went to New York on Independence Day, where I loved the architecture and took a lot of photos (I'll be updating those photos on my website later).
